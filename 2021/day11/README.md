`day11.cabal` is the cabal file for `animation.hs`. This was my first time ever using cabal.
`day11` is the binary of `animation.hs` compiled on x86 Arch Linux.

You use `day11` by doing `./day11 <delay between steps in ms> <max run time in s>`

For example, `./day11 500 10` will show a new step every 0.5 seconds for10 seconds.
