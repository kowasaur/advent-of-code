I solved part 1 using [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/quipwaxmxl). I made an algorithm in it that successfully solves the example input but it failed for my actual input. It failed because I assumed that once a point was no longer in the target area, any higher initial velocity would fail but what I should have tested is the point after the graph crosses the x axis. I ended up getting the answer by playing with the variables and checking visually.
