These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). I tried to use a variety of languages including my own, [g4m3rscr1pt](https://github.com/kowasaur/g4m3rscr1pt). I do not (as of writing this) know most of these languages well at all. Some were my first time using the language.
