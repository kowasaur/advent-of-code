I originally tried to solve this using Desmos. It worked for the example input but it didn't work for the actual input because lists can't have more than 10,000 elements. I tried splitting the input list into 30 different lists but it was still too big; I got up to day 75 and then it wouldn't go further and eventually my PC crashed. Here's the link: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ad6aox1gup

After doing part 2, I could definitely do it in Desmos now but I will not since I already did it in Go.
